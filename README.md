# Reticulum Native

Reticulum Native is an independent, portable C17 implementation of Reticulum,
LXMF and selected Nomad Network workflows. It is under active development and
is not yet a complete replacement for the upstream Python applications.

This project was created with extensive assistance from OpenAI Codex under
human direction and review. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by the
Reticulum, LXMF, Nomad Network or OpenAI maintainers.

## Feature status

The concise list of implemented, work-in-progress and planned functionality is
maintained in [docs/FEATURE_STATUS.md](docs/FEATURE_STATUS.md).

## Build

Requirements: CMake 3.21 or newer, Ninja, a C17 compiler, OpenSSL 3.x, bzip2,
POSIX threads and ncursesw.

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja \
  -DRETICULUM_BUILD_TESTS=ON \
  -DRETICULUM_BUILD_APPS=ON \
  -DRETICULUM_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS=ON
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

Run the terminal client with a locally created identity, message store and
interface configuration:

```sh
./build/apps/nomad-chat init my.identity
./build/apps/nomad-chat tui --config config/client.local.conf \
  my.identity history.lxms
```

Never commit identities, private keys, message stores, local configuration,
packet captures or logs containing private traffic.
